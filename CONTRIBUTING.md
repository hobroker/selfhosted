# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project and make it better,
your help is very welcome.

## How to open a pull request
- Create a personal fork of the project on Github
- Clone the fork on your local machine
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes
into your local repository
- Create a new branch from `master` to work on
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation
- If the project has tests run them
- Write or adapt tests as needed
- Add or change the documentation as needed
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`
- From your fork open a pull request targeting the `master` branch
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes
from `upstream` to your local repo and delete the extra branch
